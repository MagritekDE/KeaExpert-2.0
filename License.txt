You acknowledge and agree that the Software and Documentation (the "Licensed Products") are proprietary products of Magritek Ltd protected under international copyright law and disclosed to you by Magritek Ltd in confidence.  You shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard the Licensed Products.

Any replacement program will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by you, whichever is longer.  In no event may you bring any claim, action or proceeding arising out of the warranty set forth in this Article for more than six (6) months after the date on which the breach of warranty occurred.
