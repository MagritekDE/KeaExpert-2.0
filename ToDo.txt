To Do List

30.11.24
1. If an error message is displayed during a batch experiment if will hold up all other experiments - need to print error to CLI instead.
2. The relaxation behaviour (T1IR) of one peak in BromoTriFluoroBenzene make no sense - is this because of the large pulse length and large dispersion? Check. YES.
3. Many parameter buttons are missing help.
4. Most pulse sequence commands need updated help. Need to include DSP/FX3 sections and test sequences.
5. Check all changes to sequences/scripts which use parameters with callbacks.
6. Ask Bulat/Ernesto to check 2.02.00 using production macros. Any issues?

03.12.2024
1. Error with the DSP system related to different receiver gain values

9.12.24
1. A number of experiments still use the old FFT procedures. These should be updated.
2. Add documentation for new 2D FFT commands.
3. Add documentation for 1D/2D post processing
