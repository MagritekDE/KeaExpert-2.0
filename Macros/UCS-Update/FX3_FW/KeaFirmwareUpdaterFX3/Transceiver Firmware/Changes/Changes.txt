V2008 ... increased acquisition sum mode from a max. of 64 to 128 points
V2009 ... BRAM used to store summed data sets allowing up to 4k points
V2010 ... Fixed bug preventing certain tables commands from using all event-table memory
V2011 ... Fixed acquire-append bug in flat filter mode which caused a shift in each echo by 1 point
