Application installed.

In the next window the following options are available:


1. "Install the USB Driver" option. You should check this option the first time you use the Spinsolve spectrometer. The spectrometer does not have to be connected unless you are using Windows XP.

2. "Launch SpinsolveExpert". This option may also be selected via the desktop short-cut "SpinsolveExpert".

3. "View release notes". This displays the release notes using the default PDF viewer.
