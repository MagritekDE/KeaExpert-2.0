Preinstallation options.

In the next window the following options are available:


1. "Clean install" option. You should select this option if you have a previous SpinsolveExpert installation and you are concerned that the old preferences will conflict with the new software. In this case the old preferences will be moved to a backup folder in the Prospa user preferences folder.

2. "Uninstall existing installation". If you are installing over an existing installation of SpinsolveExpert you should perform an uninstall first.

3. "Creat a desktop icon" will provide convenient access to the SpinsolveExpert interface.
